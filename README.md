## Hello there! 
### I’m a Sophomore student at Northeastern University pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience. I’m interested in applying computational tools to biological and behavioral questions, particularly in research and healthcare settings.

#### Interests
- Computational and behavioral neuroscience
- Biomedical and health-related data analysis
- Neurodevelopmental and neurodivergent conditions
- Translational research and real-world applications
  
#### Experience
Research Assistant at Northeastern Shansky Neuroanatomy and Behavior Lab | Boston MA (May 2025 - Present)           		             
- Handled and cared for laboratory rats to prepare for behavioral and pharmacological experiments
- Performed stereotaxic infusions to deliver DREDDS virus in rodent models for tract tracing
- Operated a vibratome to slice brain tissue for histological analysis
- Mounted brain tissue samples for imaging and neuroanatomical investigation
- Scored and analyzed behavioral videos to assess fear and aversive learning outcomes
- Prepared and maintained stock solutions to support ongoing experimental protocols

#### Projects
Heart Failure Mortality Prediction| Python, Scikit-Learn	(November 2025)
- Analyzed a clinical dataset to identify predictors of heart failure morality
- Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers, achieved 82% accuracy
- Conducted chi-square tests and t-tests to determine statistically significant correlations
- Identified key risk factors including serum creatinine, age and ejection fraction
- Interpreted model coefficients and correlations to assess the clinical relevance of predictors and explain model behavior

Pipeline for Fiber Photometry Signal Processing and Artifact Correction | Python	(December 2025)
Developed pipeline for fiber photometry, integrating artifact corrections and experiment aligned segmentation
- Implemented TTL-based event detection to identify experimental epochs and align neural signals with behavioral stimuli
- Designed a derivative based artifact detection method to identify artifacts in fluorescence time series data
- Removed corrupted signals and reconstructed missing data via linear interpolation
- Ensured synchronized processing across multiple signal channels

Medical AI Model for Classifying Alzheimer’s MRI | Python (October 2024)
Developed a program that classifies Alzheimer’s disease using deep learning techniques	                                       
- Machine learning and deep learning: implemented TensorFlow and Keras
- Integrated a pre-trained model to enhance accuracy
- Visualized data with Matplotlib

#### Skills
Software/Languages: Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, SPSS, LaTeX, Racket, Excel
Data Science: Machine learning (K-Nearest neighbors, Logistic Regression, Scikit-Learn), data visualization (Matplotlib)
Laboratory: PCR, gel electrophoresis, tissue mounting, animal handling, stereotoxic infusions (tract tracing), vibratome 
Languages: English (Native), Japanese (Bilingual fluency), Chinese (Intermediate)
